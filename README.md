## Getting Started
Weather prediction and warning system is to be developed to accurately predict and warn concert goers of any hazardous weather conditions. The system is developed to create to send out regular updates and warning via a website and social networks (Facebook). This is done in order to provide a more accessible service to the targeted audience.
### Prerequisites
```
-None-
```
### Functionality
* Upgraded weather change prediction and associated warning/alert dissemination system.
* Basic weather pattern change representation(s), models and visualisations (GUIs) to show key weather change indicators (temp, barometric pressure, light, humidity, dust and smoke particles, etc.), the magnitude/intensity and severity of change, etc.
The system predicts their occurrence (time, location, and period) on daily and weekly basis.
* Utilises sensor/actuation technology and life-feed (the Internet) to detect, monitor and generate alerts (disseminate warnings about the event) to nominated users/groups/community.
* Explores application of various ways of disseminating and mapping events, as well as, the use of predictive analytics and statistics.
* Expansions into the social aspects of effective warning messages (i.e., friendly reminders about taking an umbrella, wearing sunglasses, applying a sunscreen, taking a jumper or a coat, etc.
